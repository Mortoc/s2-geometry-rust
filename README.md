# S2 Geometry Rust

An experimental Rust port of the Google S2 geometry library, created with Claude Code.

## Status

This project provides a Rust implementation of core S2 geometry functionality including:

- S2Point: 3D points on the unit sphere
- S1Angle & S1ChordAngle: Spherical angle representations  
- S2LatLng: Latitude/longitude coordinates
- S2Cap: Spherical caps with precision-aware intersection testing
- S2Cell & S2CellId: Hierarchical cell decomposition system

## Test Coverage

Currently achieving 93% test coverage for S2Cap implementation (13/14 tests passing) with systematic C++/Rust compatibility validation.

## Building

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Architecture

The implementation follows a three-tier mathematical precision approach (fast/stable/exact paths) while maintaining memory safety and C++ compatibility.
